Comments:
i initially had a misunderstanding of the problem (distance was modulo), that prevented me from thinking about the problem properly. I was storing the distances with a modulo for a while, but that just makes the problem a lot trickier to deal with. Kind of an ad hoc problem. Disappointed that I didn't solve this one quicker.
