Estimated Time Used: 1 hour
Algorithm: Math + interval sets
Status(Obvious/Medium/Hard/Hint/Editorial): Hint
Comments:
Handling all the corner cases when handling intervals in sets is pretty tricky.
Takeaway:
Handle edge cases completely separately when doing interval sets + lower_bound stuff. Ie: handle sets of size 0, then size 1, etc.
